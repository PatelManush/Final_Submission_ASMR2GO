Following screenshots are my projects GUI creation from QT5.
I have created four buttons to record four ASMR voices , which can be overwritten for a new voice. 
An input device selection has also been provided along with a audio and record buttons for the same. 
An audio level controlling selection has also been setup in the GUI, where we can manipulate to different audio levels of volumes. 
Apart from this, there are four standard ASMR options for producing voices such as;
      Snow Storm
      Cat Purr
      Whisper 
      Pebble Beach
A pause button has also been created.
