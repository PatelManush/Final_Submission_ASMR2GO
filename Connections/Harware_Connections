We are using Raspberry Pi 3 model B+ for making our model of ASMR2Go. This provides live recording and playing of those ASMR voices, apart from 
this there are certain ASMR standard voices from YouTube that are feeded to the model in an mp3 format. 


The voice in the system is recorded via the means of USB microphone connected to the pi. 
The user can select which voice he/she wants to play by clicking on the touch screen LCD attached to the pi. The pi is bluetooth compatible, 
for this reason we have an option for the users that they can either use a headphone or even a speaker can be enabled to play these voices.

For demonstration purposes, we are using a bluetooth speaker. 
Apart from this, the pi and the LCD screen are enclosed in starto case ,black in color for easy accessibility.
